            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began in 2018 as a small gathering of local tech enthusiasts in a community hall.
                Our founders envisioned a platform where innovative ideas could be shared freely,
                and where aspiring professionals could connect with industry veterans.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, TechCon has grown exponentially, moving to larger venues and attracting
                international speakers and attendees. We pride ourselves on fostering a vibrant
                community and remaining true to our grassroots origins. Each year brings new challenges
                and opportunities to push the boundaries of technology together.
